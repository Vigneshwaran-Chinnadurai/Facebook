Facebook Login/Sign-In Page :

      Welcome to the Facebook Login/Sign-In Page HTML and CSS project! In this project, you will create a web page that mimics the appearance and functionality of the Facebook login/sign-in page using HTML and CSS.

      Project Goals :

            Replication : Your primary objective is to replicate the visual design and layout of the Facebook login/sign-in page as accurately as possible using HTML for structure and CSS for styling.

            Responsive Design : Ensure that your page is responsive and adapts smoothly to different screen sizes, providing an optimal viewing experience across devices, from desktop computers to smartphones.

            Form Styling : Pay close attention to styling the login form elements such as input fields, buttons, and links to closely resemble those found on the Facebook login page.

            Typography and Colors : Use appropriate typography and colors to match the Facebook brand identity, including font styles, sizes, and colors used for text and background elements.
